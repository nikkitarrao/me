            ],
            "correctChoice": "A",
            "explanation": "ArrayLists cannot be composed of primitive data types, and since int is a primative type, you must use the wrapper class version of int, Integer. Also, ArrayList is a class, which is why is must include parenthases at the end."

            "explanation": "You must invoke arrow syntax using a variable, so in this case, we declare a variable named 'value' using the 'let' keyword. Also, the parameters x and y must be in parenthases. "

            "correctChoice": "===",
            "explanation": "Javascript has two different opperators that are able to deetermine whether values are equal. The non-strict equals operator only compares value (regardless of data-type), and is denoted with the symbol '=='. The strict equals operator, on the other hand, which determines if two values are of both the same data-type as well as value is denoted by '==='. "
